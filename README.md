# VoltaV
Flask app for filtering/visualizing parquet data.

## Quickstart
For development, clone the repository and once you are in the NEDCO_data_viz_app directory, create a .env file with these two variables and fill them in
'''sh
BUCKET_URL = ""
SUPABASE_KEY=""
'''

To run this app locally, run this in the command line (you might need to replace "python" with "python3")
'''sh
python run.py
'''
